Time Machine Request
          https://api.darksky.net/forecast/[key]/[latitude],[longitude],[time]
        
A Time Machine Request returns the observed (in the past) or forecasted (in the future) hour-by-hour weather and daily weather conditions for a particular date. A Time Machine request is identical in structure to a Forecast Request, except:

The currently data point will refer to the time provided, rather than the current time.
The minutely data block will be omitted, unless you are requesting a time within an hour of the present.
The hourly data block will contain data points starting at midnight (local time) of the day requested, and continuing until midnight (local time) of the following day.
The daily data block will contain a single data point referring to the requested date.
The alerts data block will be omitted.

Request Parameters
Required parameters slot directly into the request URL. Optional parameters should be specified as HTTP query parameters.

key required
Your Dark Sky secret key. (Your secret key must be kept secret; in particular, do not embed it in JavaScript source code that you transmit to clients.)
latitude required
The latitude of a location (in decimal degrees). Positive is north, negative is south.
longitude required
The longitude of a location (in decimal degrees). Positive is east, negative is west.
time required
Either be a UNIX time (that is, seconds since midnight GMT on 1 Jan 1970) or a string formatted as follows: [YYYY]-[MM]-[DD]T[HH]:[MM]:[SS][timezone]. timezone should either be omitted (to refer to local time for the location being requested), Z (referring to GMT time), or +[HH][MM] or -[HH][MM] for an offset from GMT in hours and minutes. The timezone is only used for determining the time of the request; the response will always be relative to the local time zone.
